# Pricing-Tesla-Option-Using-Object-Oriented-Programming
The aim of this project is to price the call option using object-oriented programming (OPP) approach in python.
# General Background 
Option traders rely on the implied volatility since it is a better way of estimating future volatility and it considers market expectations such as major market events.
The Black â€“ Scholes Model can be used to derive the implied volatility.
In this project, we will calculate the implied volatility for Tesla call option using the Brute force iterative method with 40,000 possible solutions.
After calculating the implied volatility, we will proceed to price the call option by implementing object-oriented programming (OPP) approach in python.
